\secrel{Abstract}

This paper describes an automatic program generator which creates PROLOG
programs from input/output specifications. The generator takes as input
descriptions of the input and output data types, a set of tests, a set of
transformations and the input/output relation. Abstract data types are used as
models for data. They are defined as sets of terms satisfying a system of
equations. The tests, the transformations and the input/output relation are
also specified by equations.
