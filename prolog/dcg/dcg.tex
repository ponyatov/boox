\secly{Conclusion}

In conclusion, I'd remind you - if you're working with lists, DCG's can
definitely make your life easier. They're not just for parsing any more!

Thanks for taking this tutorial. If I can improve anything please email me at

Thanks,

This tutorial is based on a tutorial by \emph{Markus Triska}, so a special nod
to him.

\emph{Ulrich Neumerkel}, \emph{Richard O'Keefe}, \emph{Carlo Capelli}, and
\emph{Paulo Moura} patiently explained many points on the swipl email list.

\emph{Michael Richter} applied his thorough critical eye to the text.

Props to the Sanskrit grammarian \emph{Paa√±ini}, who first formalized grammar.
