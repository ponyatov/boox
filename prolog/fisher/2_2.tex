\secrel{2.2 Два определения факториала}\label{fish22}

This section introduces the student to computations of mathematical functions
using \prolog. Various built-in arithmetic operators are discussed. Also
discussed is the concept of a \prolog derivation tree, and how derivation trees
are related to tracings of \prolog.
