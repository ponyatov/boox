Server}\\

The Amzi! Prolog IDE, with it's source code debugger, is an excellent tool for
getting a solid understanding of Prolog's dynamic variable binding and built-in
search.

The Amzi! Logic Server provides the tools for deploying Prolog with other
development tools.

The full Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server package is available on either:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
