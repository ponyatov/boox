\begin{framed}
Adventure established the architecture of all fantasy computer games to follow.
It was the first to create structures representing places and items and
characters and to let the player explore and interact with the environment.

It was as totally addictive as today's wonderous graphical games that have built
on the that very same architecture.

To learn more about the granddaddy of all such games, see:

Adventure} and/or google Adventure and Willie Crowther.
