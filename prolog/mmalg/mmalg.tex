\subsecly{Abstract}

The unification problem in first-order predicate calculus is described in
general terms as the solution of a system of equations, and a nondeterministic
algorithm is given. A new unification algorithm, characterized by having the
acyclicity test efficiently embedded into it, is derived from the
nondeterministic one, and a PASCAL implementation is given. A comparison with
other well-known unification algorithms shows that the algorithm described here
performs well in all cases.
