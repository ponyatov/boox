\secly{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}

The first author’s initiation to Prolog developed from the close contacts that he
has had with the Groupe d’Intelligence Artificielle (GIA) at the University of
Marseilles, Luminy, in France. Alain Colmerauer, Michel van Caneghem, Henri 
Kanoui, Bob Pasero, and Francis Giannesini were all enthusiastic in sharing
with him their knowledge of the language they have developed and refined at
GIA. Three graduate students from Marseilles: Sylvie Duchenoy, Robert Kong
Win Chang, and Sophie Nabitz helped in testing the programs presented here.
In particular, Robert Kong, now at Brandeis, has dedicated countless hours in
helping us polish the paper. David Hildum implemented the Glanville-Graham
code-generation method described in Section 7. Peter Appel and Cindy Lurie did
their honor’s projects prototyping Prolog versions of LEX and YACC. We count
ourselves lucky to have had the opportunity to interact with the above-mentioned
persons. 

Finally, we wish to express our gratitude to a referee, David S. Warren, who,
following a meticulous reading of the original manuscript, helped identify the
major issues of Prolog usage in compiling and urged us to discuss them in the
revised paper. The thoughtful and detailed remarks made by this referee provided
an added incentive to improve the paper and reaffirmed our respect for the
refereeing process.
