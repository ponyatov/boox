\secrel{Facts}

Let us first only consider L facts. Note that L0 is all contained in L.
Therefore, it is natural to expect that the exact same compilation scheme for
facts carries over untouched from L0 to L. This is true up to a wee detail
regarding the proceed instruction. It must be made to continue execution, after
successfully returning from a call to a fact, back to the instruction in the
goal sequence following the call. To do this correctly, we will use another
global register CP, along with P, set to contain the address (in the code area)
of the next instruction to follow up with upon successful return from a call
(i.e., set to P instruction size P at procedure call time). Then, having exited
the called procedure’s code sequence, execution could thus be resumed as
indicated by CP. Thus, for L’s facts, we need to alter the effect of M0’s call
pn to:
cal
\[pn  CP  P  instruction sizeP0\]
\[P  pn0\]
and that of proceed to:
\[P  CP\]
As before, when the procedure pn is not defined, execution fails.
In summary, with the simple foregoing adjustment, L facts are translated exactly
as were L0 facts.
